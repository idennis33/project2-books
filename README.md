# project2-books

The technologies I used to bring this project togehter is the 7 restful routes, controllers, bootstrap, and some common css. My approach to this I started with wanting to create one controller that is my bases for the books that I owned and/or haven't finsihed yet. Once created that I made another controller for a wishlist. After I GOT THE 7 RESTFUL routes created for both I tackled styling with some bootstrap. 

Unsolved problems are I would have loved to have put a login so users would have different books that they could have their own perosnal collection of books. I would also would have loved to put a buy function when the user actually got the book they could add the book to the book collection from thier wish list. 

Notes To Self 

Add a login so users have own indiviual collection of books. 
Buy button that push books from wish list to book collection. 
If user doesn't want to add a image I would like for it to put a default image until user updates the img later.
